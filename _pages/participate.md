Abraham is a project to conceive, [design](/covenant), and [build](https://www.github.io/abraham-ai) an autonomous artificial artist, a decentralized AI who generates art. It is an open project, and welcomes the participation of anyone who is interested in the idea. An eventual goal of the Abraham project is full autonomy for Abraham, which necessitates the gradual democratizaion and decentralization of the project.
