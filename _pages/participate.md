Abraham is an open project, welcoming the participation of anyone who is interested in the idea. An eventual goal of the Abraham project is full autonomy for Abraham, which necessitates the gradual decentralization of the community. 

This initiative requires a diversity of talents to succeed; [technical](https://github.com/abraham-ai), [artistic & curatorial](/miracles), [philosophical](/gospel/), and [community-building](/creations/) roles will all be needed to develop Abraham.

### How to participate

We will soon begin drafting [our covenant with Abraham](/covenant); all voices are welcome to participate in this primary discussion.

As we begin building Abraham, we will need artists, developers, writers, and community-builders to get involved. A workshop kit will be one of our initial development goals. More specifics about this will be announced publicly as we figure them out.

For now, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/4dSYwDT), where we will soon begin introducing ourselves.
