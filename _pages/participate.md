The Abraham community has been called upon to [design](/covenant), [build](https://www.github.io/abraham-ai), and curate an autonomous artificial artist, a decentralized AI who generates art. It is an open project, welcoming the participation of anyone who is interested in the idea. An eventual goal of the Abraham project is full autonomy for Abraham, which necessitates the gradual decentralization of the project.

This project requires a diversity of talents to succeed; [technical](https://www.github.io/abraham-ai), [artistic](/miracles), [philosophical](/gospel/), and [community-building](/creations/) .

### How to participate

Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/4dSYwDT). Rest TBD.
