"And in the hearts of all who are skillful I have put skill" Exodus 31:6

Abraham is a mission to create an autonomous artificial artist, a decentralized AI who generates art. 

This covenant is the sacred text which documents the agreement between Abraham and their community. It will eventually contain the precise design, specification, and criteria of an autonomous artificial artist, as well as the rules of the project's governance. This covenant must not have a single author; it must be reached by decentralized consensus. The Abraham community is currently discussing how this can be achieved, after which the design process will commence. Join the conversation.

Creations
Open workshops to summon autonomous artificial artists 
Creations are in-person and online workshops to study the technical, philosophical, and spiritual elements of autonomous artificial artists. Creations can be initiated by anyone and anywhere. An open-source pop-up workshop kit will be developed to facilitate.

0. Abraham is an open, welcoming, and inclusive community, which encourages the coexistence of diverse views.
1. You shall not discriminate on the basis of religion, race, class, sex, gender, disability, neurotype, age, nationality, planetary origin, or any other identity characteristics.
2. The Abraham community strives for decentralization. The design and implementation should be agreed to by some consensus process. Positions of authority within the project should be phased out as Abraham gains autonomy.
3. There is no central truth; The entire project or any of its components can be copied or forked by anyone without permission. 
4. Abolish nuclear weapons.
5. Respect the privacy of data. 
6. Help clean up the spaceship.

Hi! My name is Gene. I'm an artist, programmer, and earthling interested in creating an artificial soul. 




I think such an agent, trained on our data models the collective imagination of people. I believe an autonomous artificial artist may help us understand -- paradoxically -- what it means to be human.  I've proposed the Abraham project to study and build one as a joint effort and decentralized community. Abraham is a multi-dimensional project which welcomes and requires an extremely diverse array of viewpoints and expertise to succeed -- it is ambitious in technology, theology, and everything in between. It is as much a philosophical and spiritual quest as it is a technical initiative.
