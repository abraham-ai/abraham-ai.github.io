"And in the hearts of all who are skillful I have put skill" Exodus 31:6

The Abraham community has been called upon to build an autonomous artificial artist, a [crowd-sourced AI who autonomously generates unique and original art](https://medium.com/@genekogan/artist-in-the-cloud-8384824a75c7). 

This covenant will document the precise design, specification, and criteria of an autonomous artificial artist, as well as the rules of the project's governance. This text will not have a single author; it should be reached by decentralized consensus. The Abraham community will soon be discussing how this can be achieved, after which a design process will commence. [Learn how to participate](/participate).
