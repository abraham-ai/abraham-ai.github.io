"And in the hearts of all who are skillful I have put skill" Exodus 31:6

Abraham is a mission to create an autonomous artificial artist, a decentralized AI who generates art. 

This covenant documents the precise design, specification, and criteria of an autonomous artificial artist, as well as the rules of the project's governance. This covenant will not have a single author; it must be reached by decentralized consensus. The Abraham community is currently discussing how this can be achieved, after which a design process will commence. [Join the conversation](https://discord.gg/4dSYwDT).
